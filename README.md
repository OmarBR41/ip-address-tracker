# Frontend Mentor - IP Address Tracker

Developed with React and CSS. Mobile first approach with responsive design. Added an open/close state to the IP details box on small screens, so it doesn't affect the map.

## Features

Users are able to:

- See their own IP Address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## APIs

- IP information extracted from [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/).
- Map rendered using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).
